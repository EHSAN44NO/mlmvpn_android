// matters: it is read on the routing path of **every** request, and a D1 read there would be a read
// per tunnel connection to answer a question that never changes. It is also what lets a second
// device recover the route from Cloudflare instead of the phone (plan §B.2.2).
//
// Without that binding -- every build-5 installation -- none of this is reachable, and the worker
// behaves exactly as it did before.
