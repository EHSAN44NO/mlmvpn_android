//
// A cap is only a cap if the check and the admission happen in one indivisible step. Everything
// simpler than a Durable Object fails exactly under the load the cap exists to limit:
//
//   * **KV** is eventually consistent, up to a minute. Two devices in two colos both read `count = 0`
//     and both are admitted. A limit that fails open under contention is decoration.
//   * **A D1 table** works and the write budget kills it, and D1 has no cross-statement transaction
//     from a Worker, so the read-then-insert is racy anyway.
//   * **A Durable Object** is single-threaded per object, so the critical section is free, and its
//     SQLite storage does not touch the D1 budget at all.
//
// One object **per user**: `idFromName("u:" + uid)`.
//
// **Build 18: devices connected NOW, not devices ever seen.** The limit the operator types is "this
// many phones at the same time" (agreed with the operator, 2026-09-26). The object used to keep every
// device it had ever admitted, forever, so one phone that moved from Wi-Fi to mobile data became two
// devices and a 1-device user was locked out until somebody pressed «فراموش کن». It now keeps a
// device *present* while an isolate reports it, and lets a device that has gone quiet hand its slot
// to a new one -- the same phone on its new network.
//
// And it is asked once per device per isolate per minute, not per connection: one app opens dozens of
// connections, and a Durable Object request for each of them was both the cost and the slowness.
//
// Two rules this file keeps:
//
//   * **It never reads D1.** The caller already loaded the user row to authenticate them, so the
//     policy arrives as an argument.
//   * **No raw client IP is ever stored.** Only `sha256(salt ‖ ip)`, truncated — enough to count
//     distinct addresses, not enough to be a list of who connected from where on somebody else's
//     Cloudflare account.
