/**
 * The SOCKS5 server that tun2socks talks to whenever the tunnel behind it cannot
 * carry UDP itself.
 *
 * Two transports need it, for the same reason and with different DNS behind it:
 * **Tor**, whose SocksPort is CONNECT-only, and **the Rust core in Proxy Mode**
 * (MASQUE, WireGuard, WARP-on-WARP -- see `TunnelVpnService.startNativeProxyTunnel`),
 * whose `socks::serve` is likewise CONNECT-only. Everything below was written for
 * Tor and holds word for word for the core; only [resolve] differs between them,
 * because Tor has a local DNSPort to forward to and the core does not.
 *
 * ## Why this class has to exist at all
 *
 * In Psiphon mode tun2socks is pointed straight at Psiphon's own SOCKS listener
 * and UDP works because of a coincidence of Psiphon's design: tun2socks is told
 * `udpgwServerAddress = 127.0.0.1:7300` and dials it *through* the SOCKS proxy,
 * and the Psiphon **server** intercepts that exact address
 * (`UDPInterceptUdpgwServerAddress` in tunnelServer.go) and does the UDP
 * forwarding remotely. There is no local udpgw daemon anywhere in this app.
 *
 * Tor has no such thing. Two hard facts, both verified against the sources:
 *
 *  1. **Tor's SOCKS port has no UDP ASSOCIATE.** It is CONNECT-only.
 *  2. Pointing tun2socks at Tor directly makes it try to CONNECT to
 *     `127.0.0.1:7300` *through the Tor circuit*, which Tor refuses (private
 *     address), so `SocksUdpGwClient` reconnect-loops forever.
 *
 * The Rust core behaves the same way, measured on a device rather than assumed:
 * a SOCKS5 CONNECT to `example.com:80` through it returns `05 00` and fetches the
 * page, while the identical CONNECT to `127.0.0.1:7300` hangs until it is killed.
 * So a WARP tunnel in Proxy Mode resolved nothing and every app reported no
 * internet on a tunnel that was, by every other measure, connected and working.
 *
 * And UDP is not optional here, because of one line in tun2socks.c:
 *
 * ```c
 * // do nothing if we don't have udpgw
 * if (!options.udpgw_remote_server_addr) { goto fail; }
 * ```
 *
 * plus `udpgw_transparent_dns = 1`, which routes **every DNS query** down the
 * udpgw path. So with Tor and no udpgw, name resolution is dead and the app
 * looks completely broken even though the Tor circuit is fine.
 *
 * ## What this does instead
 *
 * It is the SOCKS5 server tun2socks connects to, and it splits the traffic:
 *
 * ```
 *   tun2socks ──CONNECT <any ip:port>──► relay ──► upstream SOCKS ──► tunnel
 *             └─CONNECT 127.0.0.1:7300─► in-process udpgw server
 *                                          └─ DNS ──► Tor DNSPort (local UDP), or
 *                                                     DNS-over-TCP through the
 *                                                     upstream when there is none
 *                                          └─ other UDP ──► dropped
 * ```
 *
 * The udpgw branch is a real implementation of badvpn's udpgw wire protocol, so
 * badvpn itself is untouched — no patching of vendored C, and the working
 * Psiphon path keeps behaving exactly as before.
 *
 * ## Why non-DNS UDP is dropped rather than proxied
 *
 * There is nowhere to send it. Tor carries TCP streams only. Dropping is the
 * correct behaviour and not a silent failure: QUIC (UDP/443) treats an
 * unanswered handshake as "no QUIC here" and browsers fall back to TCP within a
 * few hundred milliseconds. Answering with an error, or black-holing at the
 * TUN, both produce worse stalls.
 *
 * ## DNS goes to Tor's own DNSPort
 *
 * `DNSPort` is compiled into our libtor.so (verified: the `DNSPort`,
 * `DNSListenAddress` and `dnsserv` symbols are all present in the built
 * binary). It answers on plain local UDP and resolves through the circuit, so
 * there is no DNS leak and no need to hand-roll DNS-over-TCP.
 *
 * Only A/AAAA/PTR are supported by Tor's DNSPort. A Chrome HTTPS/SVCB query
 * (type 65) gets refused, which is the same answer Chrome gets from plenty of
 * real resolvers, and it falls back without a stall.
