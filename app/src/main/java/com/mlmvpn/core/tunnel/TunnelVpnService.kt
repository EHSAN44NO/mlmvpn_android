/**
 * Where Psiphon's own server list lives.
 *
 * These are the production endpoints for propagation channel `iohq-waa4-q4dt`, read out of the
 * official Psiphon Android client rather than invented: the four hosts, their `OnlyAfterAttempts`
 * ordering and their `SkipVerify` flags are exactly what that client ships. The signature key we
 * already carry in [buildPsiphonConfig] is byte-for-byte the one that signs this list, which is
 * what makes fetching it meaningful -- an unsigned or wrongly-signed list is discarded by the
 * core, so this cannot be pointed anywhere else and quietly work.
 *
 * The first host is the origin. The other three are CDN mirrors and carry `SkipVerify`, because
 * they are reached through a front where the TLS certificate is the CDN's rather than the site's.
 *
 * ## Why this was empty until now
 *
 * `RemoteServerListURL` was set to "", so the client had exactly the 430 server entries compiled
 * into the APK and never learned another one. Of those 430, five advertise FRONTED-MEEK -- and on
 * a line where direct protocols are blocked, those five ARE the tunnel. Measured on the reporting
 * device: strategy D (all direct protocols) timed out, strategy C (in-proxy) timed out, and only
 * the fronted rung connected, at 29 KB/s. Five candidates is not a pool, it is a bottleneck, and
 * it is the one the user feels as "Psiphon connects but it is 1 Mbit".

 *    stun:… timeout while waiting for XORMappedAddr"), ICE gathering takes 34s

 * answer was a private-range address, i.e. the operator's DNS hijack. Psiphon
 * correctly refused it, so tactics never loaded and not one of the five bundled
 * FRONTED-MEEK entries could be resolved. `Tunnels: {"count":0}`.
 *
 * The resolvers we put on the TUN (`applyDns`, 1.1.1.1 / 8.8.8.8) do NOT help
 * here. Psiphon's resolver builds its own UDP socket and calls `bindToDevice` on
 * it (upstream `resolver.go`), so it leaves *outside* the TUN, straight onto the
 * operator link where UDP/53 is hijacked no matter which address is targeted.
 *
 * The port is the whole point. The hijack observed intercepts UDP/53; the same
 * providers answering on another port were reached cleanly from an uncensored
 * host. So these are ordinary public resolvers reached where the interception
 * does not sit:
 *
 *  - 208.67.222.222:5353 / 208.67.220.220:5353 — OpenDNS's alternate port
 *  - 9.9.9.9:9953 — Quad9's alternate port
 *
 * Scope, so nobody expects too much of this: it fixes name resolution only. On a
 * network that also blocks the transport itself there is nothing to resolve to,
 * and a chained run never even reaches this code — the outer WARP leg has to be
 * up first, and if it is up then DNS was never the problem. Plain Psiphon is

     * The escalation ladder, ordered by *measured* time-to-connect on a hostile
     * carrier, using the Build #65 field logs from Hamrah-e-Aval and SamanTel.
     *
     * What those logs proved:
     *
     *  - On Hamrah-e-Aval every direct dial fails at the TCP layer:
     *    TLS-OSSH, UNFRONTED-MEEK-HTTPS-OSSH, OSSH and SSH candidates all end in
     *    "connect: connection timed out" / "i/o timeout" from tcpDial#308. Not
     *    resets, not TLS errors — the packets never arrive. The carrier
     *    null-routes Psiphon server IPs.
     *  - Only FRONTED-MEEK works there, because it dials a CDN edge instead of a
     *    Psiphon-owned IP. It connected on FRONTED-MEEK-HTTP-OSSH in 33s.
     *  - The old first rung ("443-only protocols") therefore burned its entire
     *    45s budget for nothing before the fronted rung even started, which is
     *    the whole reason connecting felt slow.
     *  - On SamanTel a plain direct QUIC-OSSH dial won in seconds, so direct
     *    protocols must stay reachable early for carriers that do not block.
     *

     * `initialLimitTunnelProtocols: [INPROXY-WEBRTC-*]` instead, followed by

     * passes `[configParameters, tacticsParameters]` to `Parameters.Set`, and

     *  - rung A (fronted) sets it — the fronting domains live in the embedded
     *    server entries, so this rung needs nothing from tactics.
     *  - rung C (in-proxy) must NOT set it — broker specs arrive via tactics, and
     *    without them the peer-relay rung cannot dial at all.
     *
     * Cost: rung A loses remote tuning it was not benefiting from anyway. Benefit:
     * the 5 fronted server entries actually get dialled, which is the only path

     *
     *  1. TUN first, before either tunnel. Psiphon's NetworkMonitor treats tun0
     *     appearing as a network change and restarts the controller, which is the
     *     13-second restart loop the plain Psiphon path already works around.
     *  2. The outer WARP leg next, and we must WAIT for it. Psiphon validates
     *     UpstreamProxyURL by dialling it, so starting Psiphon against a proxy whose
     *     tunnel is not up yet fails the whole rung.
     *  3. tun2socks last, on Psiphon's port, from onConnected() — the same as the
     *     plain path. Only then does device traffic have somewhere to go.
     *
     * The core runs WITHOUT a tun_fd here (TunnelEngine.startProxy), so it publishes
     * SOCKS on CHAIN_SOCKS_PORT instead of taking the device TUN. Its own sockets
     * are protected via the JNI protector, so the WARP leg leaves over the carrier
     * link rather than looping back into our own TUN.
     *
     * The outer leg walks [CoreConfig.CHAIN_OUTER_LADDER] — MASQUE, then WireGuard,
     * then WoW — until one comes up, because which of them a carrier allows varies:
     * Hamrah-e-Aval has never carried WireGuard, while other SIMs connect on it
     * instantly. The winning rung is remembered per device, so the cost of finding
     * it is paid once rather than on every connect.

     * Deliberately shaped like the plain Psiphon path rather than the Rust-core
     * one, because the sequencing constraint is the same: the TUN must exist
     * before the tunnel process starts, or Android's new-network callback makes
     * the tunnel treat tun0 as a network change and restart.
     *
     * Unlike Psiphon this path is **synchronous** — there is no connect callback
     * to wait on. [TorManager.start] blocks on its worker thread until bootstrap
     * reaches 100% or every mode has failed, so tun2socks is started right here
     * once it returns true.
     *
     * ## Tor over WARP
     *
     * When [TorManager.chainArmed] agrees, a WARP leg is raised first and Tor is
     * pointed at its SOCKS listener, exactly as Psiphon-over-WARP does — the same
     * [raiseOuterLeg] ladder (MASQUE → WireGuard → WoW) and the same per-device
     * memory of which rung worked, untouched. Only Tor's own ladder narrows:
     * Direct then Meek, because those are the two that were measured working
     * through a proxy (see [TorManager] `chainedLadder`).
     *
     * [chainMode] is set for a chained Tor run as well, and it is load-bearing for
     * three behaviours in [onEvent] that are about the outer leg rather than about
     * Psiphon: the premature CONNECTED is swallowed, the outer traffic counters are
     * dropped in favour of the inner leg's, and the outer exit IP is not published
     * as the session's exit. All three are exactly what a chained Tor run needs.
     * The Psiphon-specific reads of [chainMode] are unreachable here: no
     * `psiphonLadder`, no `armRegionPhase`, no Psiphon config is built on this path.
     *
     * Note what is still NOT done here: no ladder, no `armRegionPhase`, no
     * `recordWorkingPlainTransport`. Those all belong to the Psiphon/WARP
     * transports. Tor keeps its own mode memory inside [TorManager].

    /**
     * MASQUE, WireGuard or WARP-on-WARP in Proxy Mode: TUN → tun2socks → the core's
     * own SOCKS5 listener → the tunnel.
     *
     * The whole device is still tunnelled — this is not "proxy instead of VPN" — but
     * the core reaches the traffic through a local listener rather than by owning the
     * tun file descriptor, and that listener is the thing Local Network sharing can
     * hand to another device. Without it these three transports had no listener at
     * all ([TunnelStatus.isNativeTunMode]), so the sharing screen told the user to
     * turn Proxy Mode on and Proxy Mode did nothing for them: this service never read
     * the setting. That was the bug.
     *
     * Nothing here is new machinery. [startChainTunnel] already runs the core with
     * [TunnelEngine.startProxy] and [startTorTunnel] already bridges a TUN into a
     * local SOCKS port with [Tun2SocksManager]; this is those two halves put

     * tunnel starts, or Android's new-network callback makes the core treat tun0 as
     * a network change.
     *
     * What is deliberately NOT carried over from the default path: the core's own
     * addresses, `applyGatewayProxy`, `applyDns` and `applyLanAccess`. The TUN here
     * belongs to tun2socks and uses its private address plan, so the resolver is
     * lwIP's router address and DNS goes through udpgw into the tunnel like every

     *
     * Reported from the field: after some hours the notification still said
     * connected, but nothing had internet. Opening the app showed the tunnel
     * already disconnected, and tapping connect fixed it. Two separate faults
     * produced that:
     *
     *  1. **Nothing noticed.** On the Psiphon and Tor paths the data plane is
     *     `tun2socks` + a tunnel process. If those die without the service being
     *     told — a Psiphon controller exit after a long doze, tun2socks unwinding
     *     on a network change, Tor's process being killed by the OEM's memory
     *     manager — no callback fires. `connected` stays true and the
     *     notification keeps its last text forever. (The Rust-core path is
     *     different: its `finally` block runs and reports FAILED.)
     *  2. **Nothing recovered.** Even where the failure *was* reported, the only
     *     response was to paint the UI red and wait for a human.
     *
     * ## Shape
     *
     * A 30-second poll — the cheapest thing that can detect case 1 at all, and
     * ~2,900 wakeups over 24 hours of connection, which is inside the budget for
     * a foreground VPN service that is already holding a TUN. It only asks
     * questions that are free (are these threads/processes alive) and never
     * touches the network, so a doze-suppressed tick costs nothing.
     *
     * Deliberately **not** an HTTP health check: our own package is off the TUN
     * (`addDisallowedApplication`), so a probe from here rides the carrier link
     * and proves nothing about the tunnel — the same trap documented in
     * `openTunnelConnection`. Process liveness is the honest signal available in
     * the service.

     * every rung still gets a turn but the likeliest one goes first. That matters
     * more here than in the Psiphon ladder: a rung the carrier blocks outright does
     * not fail fast — MASQUE keeps scanning gateways until its budget expires — so a
     * wrong starting rung costs the user most of a minute.
     *
     * Evidence is ranked, strongest first:
     *
     *  1. [CoreConfig.CHAIN_OUTER_PREF] — a transport that has carried Psiphon
     *     inside it before. Direct evidence about the exact job at hand.
     *  2. [CoreConfig.PLAIN_WORKING_TRANSPORT_PREF] — a transport that reached the
     *     internet unchained on this carrier. Weaker (carrying Psiphon is harder
     *     than carrying ordinary traffic, so this can still fail) but far better
     *     than a static order, and it is the common case for a user who used the
     *     app normally before arming the chain.
     *  3. Ladder order — a fresh install with no history at all starts at MASQUE and
     *     walks the usual sequence.
     *
     * Each rung gets its own budget (see [chainOuterBudgetMs]) and the core is fully
     * stopped between attempts: the core's start call refuses to run twice
     * concurrently (its RUNNING compare_exchange returns "already running"), so the
     * next rung would fail instantly if the previous one were still unwinding.
