// Reaching GitHub from a network that does not want the app to.
//
// The update screen reported, verbatim:
//
//     Unable to resolve host "github.com": No address associated with hostname
//
// -- while the version check beside it had worked and was showing the release name and its size.
// Both facts matter. The check talks to `api.github.com` and the download to `github.com`, and on
// an Iranian line those two names are not treated the same: one resolved and the other was
// answered with nothing at all. So the app knew an update existed and could not fetch a byte of
// it, which is the worst of the three possible states.
//
// Two things are wrong and both are fixed here.
//
// **The name is resolved by the network's own resolver.** That resolver is the thing doing the
// blocking, so asking it is asking the wrong party. Every request from this file resolves over
// DNS-over-HTTPS instead, to a resolver addressed BY IP so that resolving the resolver is not
// itself a DNS lookup.
//
// **The download does not use the tunnel, even when one is up.** It cannot by accident: the VPN
// services exclude this app from their own tunnel -- they must, or the tunnel's traffic would
// re-enter the interface it is feeding -- so an ordinary socket from here leaves on the carrier's
// link however healthy the tunnel is. The only way in is the local proxy the engine publishes,
// and that is what this points at whenever there is one.
