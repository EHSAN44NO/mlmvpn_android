// =================================================================================================
// «ام‌ال‌ام استور» for Android — the same store the Windows app has, rebuilt for a phone.
//
// Four kinds of thing are listed, and they are updated in genuinely different ways:
//
//   برنامه    MLM VPN itself, through the updater it already had (update/UpdateChecker.kt).
//   هسته‌ها   the native engines. A downloaded engine is run from the store's own folder, never
//             from nativeLibraryDir (which only the package installer can write) — see
//             StoreEngines.kt for how that is possible on Android 10+ and what it cannot cover.
//   ورکرها    the panels the app deploys to the user's OWN Cloudflare account. The store keeps the
//             code the app will deploy next (StoreFiles) AND replaces the code of the ones already
//             deployed, keeping every binding, secret and database (StoreWorkers.kt).
//   داده‌ها   files the engines read: Xray's routing data, the Iran profiles, and so on.
//
// Where a newer version comes from, per item ([StoreSource]):
//   * the DEVELOPER's own GitHub — a release asset or a file on a branch pinned to its commit;
//   * the signed channel (StoreChannel.kt) — our own builds, and anything we tested first;
//   * the app itself — what Android does not allow to be swapped at runtime.
