// =================================================================================================
// Dragging on the home screen, the iOS way.
//
// One drag can cross three surfaces: the board, a folder sprung open by holding an app over it,
// and back out onto the board when the app leaves the folder's panel. No single composable lives
// through all of that -- the icon's own cell leaves the board the moment it is picked up, and a
// folder's cells are gone when it closes -- so the drag does not belong to any of them. A cell only
// notices the long press and hands the pointer over; from then on [HomeDrag] follows the finger
// from the home screen's root ([homeDragTracker]), works out what is under it from geometry the
// grids publish ([GridGeometry]), and draws the icon itself in a layer above everything
// ([DragLayer]).
//
// Nothing changes the arrangement until the finger lifts. While it moves, the board shows the
// layout with the item lifted out of it ([BoardLayoutRules.lift]) and a gap where it would land;
// the drop is one of BoardLayoutRules' pure functions, applied once. A finger crossing the board
// therefore never reorders anything under itself, which is what made the first drag drift.
// =================================================================================================
