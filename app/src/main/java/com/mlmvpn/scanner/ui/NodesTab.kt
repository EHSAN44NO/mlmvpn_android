     * a hundred thousand URI parses and three hundred sorts over a run, so the frames the results
     * were supposed to appear in never got drawn, and everything landed at once at the end when
     * the storm stopped.
     *
     * A snapshot map moves the subscription to where the value is actually read: the row. Writing
     * one entry invalidates that one row and nothing else -- no filter, no sort, no re-derivation.
     * It is what the SNI config list already does, which is why that one was never slow.
     *
