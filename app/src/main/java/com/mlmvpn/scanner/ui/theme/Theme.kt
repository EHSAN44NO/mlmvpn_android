// =================================================================================================
// The app-wide palette.
//
// These names date from the original dark-only design, where each was a fixed hex value. They are
// kept -- there are more than fourteen hundred uses of them across seventeen screens -- but they
// are no longer constants. Each now resolves through the same iOS palette Settings uses, so a
// screen written years ago picks up the glass look and the Appearance setting without a single
// edit to its own file.
//
// Two rules run through all of it:
//
// 1. TEXT IS WHITE IN BOTH APPEARANCES. Every surface in the app now sits on the wallpaper, and
//    white is the only colour that reads against both a dark preset and a bright photo. The
//    consequence is deliberate and worth stating: "light" here means lighter GLASS, not a white
//    sheet. A white sheet with white text would be unreadable, so even the no-wallpaper fallback
//    stays dark enough to carry white type.
//
// 2. SURFACES ARE TRANSLUCENT, NOT OPAQUE. What used to be a solid card is now a wash that lets
//    the backdrop through. That is what makes a screen written for the old design line up with
//    the home screen and Settings without being rewritten.
// =================================================================================================

// The Material colour scheme is built outside composition, so it cannot read the values above and

// surface, a DatePicker, a ripple. Those were still the old Google-console palette, which is why
// a menu opened as a grey #202124 card with a Google-blue highlight in the middle of a black
// glass app -- the "ugly, unprofessional" region picker. These are the same values the composable
// tokens resolve to in dark mode, so a Material surface now matches a hand-styled one.
