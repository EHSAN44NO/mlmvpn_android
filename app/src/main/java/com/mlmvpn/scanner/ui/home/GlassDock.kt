/**
 * The four pinned apps, in a glass bubble at the bottom of the home screen.
 *
 * Genuinely frosted, on every Android version. `Modifier.blur` was not an option -- it is a
 * no-op below API 31, so on anything older than Android 12 the dock would have lost its backdrop
 * entirely and the icons would float on nothing. See [frostedGlass] for how the blur is built
 * instead: a small copy of the wallpaper, sliced to the dock's own rectangle and stretched back.
 *
 * Like an iPhone's dock this is drawn on the home screen only. It is not a bottom nav bar: open
 * a feature and it goes away with the rest of the home screen, and back brings both back.
