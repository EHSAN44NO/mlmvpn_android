/**
 * How Tor is to reach the network.
 *
 * The one control that matters when Tor will not connect, which is why it sits on Tor's own
 * screen rather than behind advanced settings: hiding it there would hide the answer.
 *
 * The order of the automatic ladder -- direct, meek, obfs4, snowflake -- is not the order of
 * this list, and both are deliberate. The ladder is ordered by measured time-to-connect on a
 * hostile carrier; the list is ordered from least to most exotic, because that is how someone
 * reads it when deciding what their own network is doing to them.
