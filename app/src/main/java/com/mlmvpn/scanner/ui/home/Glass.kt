/**
 * Frosted glass, the way iOS does it: the card shows a blurred slice of what is actually behind
 * it, not a flat translucent fill.
 *
 * Compose has no backdrop blur, and `Modifier.blur` cannot see past its own subtree in any case
 * (nor does it exist below API 31). What makes this possible here is that we know exactly what is
 * behind every card: the wallpaper, painted once at the activity root. So the effect is built the
 * way a compositor would build it -- take a small blurred copy of the whole backdrop, work out
 * which rectangle of it this card is covering, and draw that slice stretched back to the card's
 * size. Because the copy is a fraction of the resolution, the upscale IS the blur, and it costs
 * one shared bitmap for the whole screen rather than one per card.
 *
 * The alignment is what sells it: `positionInWindow()` gives the card's offset in the same
 * coordinate space the backdrop is painted in, so the slice lines up with the pixels underneath
 * exactly. Get that wrong by a few pixels and it stops reading as glass and starts reading as a
 * texture.
 *
 * When the wallpaper is not behind the card at all -- Display > Wallpaper on every screen turned
 * off -- there is nothing to refract, so this falls back to a plain translucent card. Showing a
 * blurred wallpaper over a flat background would be inventing a reflection of something that is
 * not there.
