/**
 * Works out which country a live tunnel really comes out in.
 *
 * ## Why not Cloudflare's `loc`
 *
 * The obvious source is `cdn-cgi/trace`, and it is the wrong one twice over. It reports
 * Cloudflare's OWN view of the address, which this app has already been burned by once — see
 * the 1.2.x note in About: an American exit was being shown as Canada, and the per-config flags
 * were moved to `api.ip.sb/geoip` so both would agree with each other and with sites like ip.me.
 * And through Tor it does not report a country at all: every exit reads `loc=T1`, Cloudflare's
 * marker for "this came out of the Tor network", which is true and useless.
 *
 * So the country is resolved from the exit ADDRESS, through the same geo source the rest of the
 * app uses. That works for Tor exactly as it works for everything else.
 *
 * ## Two routes, decided by the transport
 *
 * The address itself has to be measured from inside the tunnel, and how depends on which half
 * of the stack is running:
 *
 *  - **Psiphon and Tor** publish a local SOCKS5 port ([TunnelStatus.activeSocksPort]) which is
 *    the only path from this process into the tunnel — the service excludes the app from its
 *    own tun, or the tunnel's traffic would re-enter the tun it is feeding. One request through
 *    that port returns the address AND its country together.
 *  - **MASQUE, WireGuard and WARP-on-WARP** hand the tun straight to the Rust core, which binds
 *    no listener at all — so there is no way in from here. The core measures its own exit and
 *    reports it, and the only thing left to do is look up that address's country, which can be
 *    asked over any link because the answer does not depend on who is asking.
 *
 * The first version of this got that distinction wrong and made an ordinary request in both
 * cases. It reported the PHONE's address and the phone's country, and on an Iranian line that
 * reading is indistinguishable from a tunnel genuinely exiting in Iran.
 *
 * ## A note on Tor and "the" exit
 *
 * Tor builds a separate circuit per destination, so the exit this measures is the exit for
 * *this* request. Opening a site in a browser can legitimately leave from a different relay in
 * a different country. Neither reading is wrong; there is simply no single exit to report.

     * A registration-based source would NOT do. Cymru's whois answers from the RIR record, and
