/**
 * The home screen's backdrop.
 *
 * Every preset is DRAWN, not shipped as an image. Ten wallpapers as WebP files would have added
 * roughly 3-6 MB to every APK -- and each one would still have been the wrong aspect ratio on
 * some phone, because a single crop cannot serve 18:9 and 21:9 and a foldable at once. A base
 * colour plus a handful of soft radial blobs costs zero bytes, resolves at whatever size the
 * screen happens to be, and stays sharp at any density.
 *
 * The brief for the palette was "not too bright, not too dark, not gaudy": every preset sits at
 * a low-mid lightness with restrained saturation, so white icon labels stay readable without a
 * scrim and nothing fights the icons for attention.

 * output pixel has to be the average of a neighbourhood, not a weighted pick of the two source
 * pixels either side of it.
 *
 * Three box passes approximate a Gaussian closely enough that the difference is invisible, and on
 * a bitmap this small -- a sixth of the window, so roughly 180 x 400 -- the whole thing is a few
 * hundred thousand integer operations, run once when the wallpaper or the window size changes.
 *
 * Written by hand rather than with RenderScript (deprecated, and gone from the modern toolchain)

 * screen has most of its width cut off -- and the glass, knowing nothing about that, both sampled
 * the wrong region and computed a scale several times too large. The visible result was a card
 * showing a sharp, slightly stretched, slightly misplaced piece of the picture: not blurred, and
