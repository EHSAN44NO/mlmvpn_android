/**
 * The moving lights along the bottom of the connect screen.
 *
 * Three things had to be true, and each of them was wrong in an earlier attempt:
 *
 *  1. **No edge where the colour begins.** This is why the wash is built from
 *     transparency rather than from colours mixed towards the page. Fading a
 *     colour towards white reaches white at some row, and on a four-row mesh
 *     that row is a line across the screen; fading alpha to zero reaches
 *     *nothing*, which cannot be seen at all - and it works the same in dark
 *     theme, where mixing towards white would be exactly wrong.
 *
 *  2. **Lights, not shapes.** Each light is a radial gradient far wider than the
 *     surface, so only its soft middle is ever visible and it has no rim.
 *     Where two overlap they make a third colour, which is what reads as light
 *     mixing rather than as circles stacked.
 *
 *  3. **Always moving, never on a path.** Centres and sizes are driven by value
 *     noise on separate tracks, so a light wanders and swells. Anything on a
 *     circle or a line reads immediately as an animation rather than as water.
 *
 * Deliberately hand-written and small. A mesh-gradient library was tried here
 * and brought OpenGL, a second Compose version, and a 4x4 grid whose top row is
 * a visible boundary - all to draw something four gradients and a mask do.

    // bought the frames by taking the movement out of the two states the bar is actually in --

    //   * it advances on `delay`, which requests no frame at all -- the loop only writes a float;
    //   * it is read inside the Canvas's draw lambda below, so a tick invalidates ONE display
    //     list rather than recomposing anything;
    //   * and it ticks at [TICK_MS] rather than at vsync, which it can afford because a cycle
    //     here is three minutes.

    // `noise` has no period -- its lattice is hashed, so noise(CYCLE * 0.55) and noise(0) are

    // once. Replaying this file's own noise over the real geometry: a 617px jump every three
    // minutes, against per-tick steps of about 20. The infinite transition did that too

    // seconds a tunnel takes to come up rather than for as long as the screen is open.
