/**
 * Keeps the app's two VPN services off each other's toes.
 *
 * The app now has two, and the split is deliberate. [MyVpnService] is the Xray family --
 * VLESS/VMess/Trojan/Shadowsocks nodes, GST, SoftEther, AmneziaWG, Aether -- and
 * [TunnelVpnService] is the five-transport Cloudflare/Psiphon/Tor stack with its own netstack,
 * its own kill switch and its own reconnect ladder. Merging them would put two very different
 * lifecycles behind one switch for no gain.
 *
 * What they cannot share is the device. Android grants the VPN interface to ONE service at a
 * time, and the second `Builder.establish()` does not error -- it takes the tun away from the
 * first, which is left believing it still has one. The result is a tunnel whose core is running
 * and whose packets go nowhere, and it reads to the user as "the app connected and the internet
 * stopped working". So whichever side is about to start says so here first, and the other is
 * stopped and waited for.
 *
 * The wait is the part that matters. Stopping is asynchronous on both sides: `startService` with
 * a STOP action returns immediately, and the service tears its interface down on its own thread
 * afterwards. Establishing the new tun inside that window is exactly the race above.
