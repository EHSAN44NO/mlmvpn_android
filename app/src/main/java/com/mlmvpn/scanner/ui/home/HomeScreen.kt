/**
 * The board: pages of icons, each placed by slot and slid to its slot when the slot changes.
 *
 * The first version placed every icon by absolute pixel offset with the drag delta, the drop
 * target and a settle animation all feeding one coordinate, and icons went missing when any of
 * them was wrong; the version after it used Rows, which cannot lose an icon but cannot animate one
 * from one cell to another either -- the board jumped on every move. Here a slot is the ONLY input
 * to an icon's position: the dragged icon is not on the board at all (it flies in [DragLayer]), and
 * every other icon's slot comes from its index and the gap, so the worst a mistake can do is put
 * one in the wrong cell, visibly, never off the board.
