 * The SNI anti-filter engine: one screen, one button, one connection.

 * was two screens away: build the SNI configs from "+ Add" on the connection page, then find them
 * in the list and connect one there. Nothing on either screen mentioned the other, so the ordinary
 * outcome was a user turning this on, reading "running", and concluding the app was broken.
 *
 * Now the whole thing is here and behaves like every other engine in the app: one dial, the same
 * one MASQUE, WireGuard, Psiphon and Tor use, with the same states and the same status line under
 * it. Pressing it applies the fastest route, brings up the front and connects the chosen config
 * through it -- and the status line names which of those three is happening, because a single
 * "connecting…" over a sequence that can fail in three different places tells the user nothing.
 *
 * The two measurements stay, because they answer different questions and the user needs both:
 * which ROUTE the front should dial (a TLS handshake to the edge, cheap, all eight at once), and
 * which CONFIG is fastest through it (a real proxied request, expensive, three at a time).
 *
 * Building configs is here too rather than on the connection page. It is the step that makes this
 * screen usable at all, and a feature whose first requirement lives in another screen's "+" menu
 * is a feature nobody finds.
