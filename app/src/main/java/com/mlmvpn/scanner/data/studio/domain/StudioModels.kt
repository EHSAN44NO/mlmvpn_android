/**
 * What the app talks about. Not what the worker sends.
 *
 * The boundary is the point: DTOs live in `data/studio/api/dto/` and are mapped here at the edge, so
 * a screen never holds a type whose field names are a wire format. It costs a mapper; it buys the
 * ability to change the API — rename a field, split an object, add a version — without the change
 * reaching into composables.
 *
 * The rule that keeps it honest, and it is greppable: **nothing under `ui/configstudio/` may import
 * `data.studio.api.dto`.**
 *
 * Two conventions run through all of it:
 *  * **Bytes, never GB floats.** `limit_gb REAL` cannot express exactly 30 GB, and someone given 30
 *    who is shown 29.7 has a question that costs more to answer than a Long costs to carry.
 *  * **Absolute milliseconds, never "days from creation".** The legacy schema counted expiry from
 *    `created_at`, which made renewing impossible without deleting and recreating the user — and
 *    that loses their link.

 * «بسته» — one set of terms handed to many people.
 *
 * Two properties are the whole design, and both exist because the alternative is worse:
 *
 *  * **There is no money in it, in any field, in any phase** (D6). Not a price, not a currency, not
 *    a paid-at date. What an operator arranges with someone is not this product's business, and a
 *    field named `price` eventually grows a screen to display it.
 *  * **A user's terms are COPIED from the plan, never referenced.** [SubscriptionPolicy] on a user
 *    is a snapshot taken when they were created. Editing a plan therefore changes nothing for the
 *    people already holding a link — which is the only safe default, because silently rewriting the
 *    terms of someone who is already using them is the worst thing this feature could do. Pushing an
 *    edit onto them is a separate, named, audited action.
 *
 * A plan lives on every installation in the fleet under the same [id], written by the app rather
 * than minted by a worker: syncing to N accounts means N writes that must be safe to retry, and a
 * server-generated id would make one plan a different row on every account (plan §D, R14).
