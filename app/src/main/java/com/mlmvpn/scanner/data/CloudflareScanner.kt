     * and only THEN start the real proxied tests. The verification stage -- the slow, useful part
     * -- sat idle for the whole probe, and the probe kept running long after enough candidates had
     * been found, because nothing downstream could tell it to stop.
     *
     * Now a probe pool and a verify pool run at the same time, joined by a channel. A probe that
     * opens becomes a candidate immediately; the verifiers pull candidates and run the real test.
     * The moment [successTarget] verified exits exist, both pools are cancelled -- so a lucky scan
     * finishes in seconds instead of grinding through the remaining four thousand addresses.
     *
     * Between the two sits an ADMISSION QUEUE, and that is where the strategies differ. With no
     * window ([ScanStrategy.FAST_SCAN]) a candidate goes straight across and the scan is simply as
     * fast as the network allows. With a window, candidates gather for a moment and are released
     * best-first, so the verifiers -- which are the scarce resource -- always spend their time on
     * the most promising address known so far rather than on whichever one happened to answer.
     *
     * @param testBudget the ceiling on definitive (proxied) tests. The second half of the promise
     *   the screen makes: [successTarget] decides when the scan can stop early, this decides when
     *   it has to stop anyway. Without it a scan on a network where nothing passes verification ran
     *   the entire address space with no upper bound on its own duration.
     * @param ports the ports the configs being combined actually use. Cloudflare proxies all of
     *   its TLS ports to the same origin, so an exit that is closed on 443 and open on 2053 is
     *   still a usable exit -- for a config whose port is 2053. Each is probed and the one that
     *   answers is recorded on the result.
     * @param probeNetwork the interface the TCP sweep must use, or null for the default route.
     *   Non-null only when a foreign VPN holds the default route and the user chose to scan
     *   anyway: the sweep is then pinned to the real line so the numbers describe it. The
     *   verification stage cannot be pinned -- it runs inside the Xray core -- and the screen says
     *   as much rather than implying otherwise.
