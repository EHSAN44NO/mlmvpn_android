/**
 * Puts the Config Studio engine onto a Cloudflare account -- or finds the one that is already there.
 *
 * Three things make this different from [com.mlmvpn.scanner.engines.mlm.MlmDeployer], and each is a
 * bug that deployer has:
 *
 *  1. **It looks before it deploys.** The old path derived its script name from a URL stored on the
 *     phone, so a second device found nothing, minted a random name, and created a *second* worker
 *     beside the first -- serving the old script on the old URL, outside the staleness check, and
 *     still the target of every link already handed out. See [StudioNaming] and [StudioDiscovery].
 *  2. **It refuses to go backwards.** Two devices on different app versions share one installation,
 *     which is the normal case once adoption works. Uploading an older build over a newer one takes
 *     a one-way migration backwards, so the build is read first (plan R16).
 *  3. **The secret is a `secret_text` binding, not `plain_text`.** The old deployer ships
 *     `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the clear inside the script metadata, readable by anyone with access to
 *     the Cloudflare account.
 *
 * See `android/docs/CONFIG-STUDIO-PLAN.md` §B and §8.4.
