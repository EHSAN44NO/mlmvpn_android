/**
 * Try transports in order until one is actually carrying traffic.
 *
 * For the case where there is nothing to remember: a fresh install, tapped from the Quick Settings
 * tile. The tile cannot ask a question and has no screen to show a list on, so its only honest
 * options are to open the app -- which is what it used to do, and which reads as a button that
 * does nothing -- or to go and find a working tunnel by itself. This is the second one.
 *
 * **Psiphon first, deliberately.** It brings its own server list and its own obfuscation, so it is
 * the one transport that needs nothing configured and nothing scanned to have a chance on a
 * network the app has never seen. The rest follow in descending order of how much they depend on
 * finding a reachable gateway first.
 *
 * A rung is judged by [TunnelStatus], not by whether the start command was accepted: every one of
 * these "starts" successfully and then discovers a few seconds later that it cannot reach anything.
 * That is precisely the failure the ladder exists to walk past, so the only thing worth waiting for
 * is the tunnel reporting itself up.
 *
 * Lives in a process-wide object rather than in the TileService, which the system unbinds seconds
 * after the tap -- a ladder that took thirty seconds would be killed a third of the way down it.
