/**
 * The state of Config Studio, and the only place a write to it is allowed to originate.
 *
 * A singleton with an immutable state object, following `CloudManager` and `NodeManager` rather than
 * introducing ViewModels — this app has none across ~50 screens, and one feature with a different
 * lifecycle model is a permanent seam. The one thing that differs from `CloudManager` is deliberate:
 * **the state is immutable and replaced**, never mutated in place. `CloudManager.saveAccounts()`
 * publishes the same object references, so in-place field mutation is dropped by `StateFlow`'s
 * `distinctUntilChanged`, and three screens carry a `justDeployed` flag to work around it. Copying
 * costs nothing here and removes the whole class of bug (plan F6).
