/**
 * Finds a Config Studio installation that already exists on a Cloudflare account.
 *
 * This is what makes "install it on my other phone" mean *adopt what is already there* rather than
 * *deploy a second copy*. Nothing about an installation is recovered from the device: the account
 * credential is enough, because the script name is derived from the account ([StudioNaming]) and
 * everything else is read back off Cloudflare's own API.
 *
 * **Identification is positive, never by name.** The same Cloudflare account routinely carries BPB,
 * EDG, Nahan, the DNS resolver, the VPN Gate relay and the shared pool worker. A name that merely
 * looks right is a candidate; adopting one of those by mistake and then deploying Studio over it
 * would destroy another engine's deployment, so a candidate is only adopted once its bindings or a
 * live probe say what it actually is.
 *
 * See `android/docs/CONFIG-STUDIO-PLAN.md` §B.2.2 and R15.
