/**
 * The local user index — what every list, search and count in Config Studio reads from.
 *
 * ### Why there is a local copy at all
 *
 * The plan originally said the opposite: *"Do not build a local mirror: a stale local user list that
 * disagrees with the worker is the single worst failure mode."* That was right with one Cloudflare
 * account. It became impossible once the fleet was uncapped — a dashboard cannot be fifty round
 * trips, and a list cannot page by asking fifty workers for one screen of rows. So each installation
 * is pulled incrementally from its own watermark and every read is answered from here, which is
 * O(1) in the size of the fleet.
 *
 * The objection was real, though, so the rule that answers it is enforced above this class:
 * **stale for browsing, fresh for acting.** Every mutation re-reads its one user from its own
 * installation before writing. This index is never the basis of a write.
 *
 * ### Why not Room
 *
 * The plan said Room; this is `SQLiteOpenHelper`, and the change is deliberate. Room would mean
 * introducing an annotation processor — no `kapt`, `ksp` or `annotationProcessor` exists anywhere in
 * this project today — plus its Gradle plugin and three artifacts, and an APT pass on every build of
 * a module that already takes two minutes to compile. What that buys is compile-checked SQL and a
 * migration framework, for **one table and five queries**.
 *
 * `SQLiteOpenHelper` is in the framework: no dependency, no processor, and the SQL is right here
 * where it can be read. The real requirement was never "use Room" — it was "JSON in
 * SharedPreferences cannot hold fifteen thousand rows with a search box on them", and this meets it.
 *
 * ### What is NOT in here
 *
 * Sessions, devices, activity and audit. Those are high-volume, rarely read, and inherently a recent
 * tail — they are fetched live from the one installation that owns them. A merged audit feed across
 * an uncapped fleet is not a thing that can work, and the UI says so rather than showing one that is
 * quietly incomplete.
