/**
 * Which address family of Cloudflare's edge carries tunnel traffic on THIS network, measured, and
 * a source of IPv6 edge addresses.
 *
 * Measured on the phone, 2026-09-28, after Iran's filtering was tightened: through Cloudflare IPv4
 * a Worker tunnel opened (TLS, then the WebSocket upgrade) and carried no data at all -- not a byte
 * back for plain HTTP or TLS inside it -- while the same config on Cloudflare IPv6 got a ServerHello
 * from Google in 1.1-1.9 s, and 48 of 54 random addresses across 16 Cloudflare v6 prefixes answered.
 * So nothing may assume IPv4: the families are measured and whatever works is used, and when the
 * filter moves back the measurement follows it.
 *
 * The verdict is kept per network ([networkKey]) for [TTL_MS] and shared: the scanner sets it, and
 * the combine, the Worker route, the arena and the engines read it.
