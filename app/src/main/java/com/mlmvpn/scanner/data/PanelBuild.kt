/**
 * Which build of each panel this app ships, and which build an account is actually running.
 *
 * A deployed worker is a copy, not a link: once it is on Cloudflare it stays exactly as it was
 * uploaded, however many times the app is updated afterwards. So an account deployed a year ago
 * keeps serving that year-old panel, and every fix shipped since is invisible to it -- which is
 * why "it works for me but not for them" was so often really "their worker is old".
 *
 * Bump the constant for a panel whenever its bundled asset changes. An account whose recorded
 * number is lower is told to redeploy, and the redeploy overwrites the script it already has
 * rather than leaving the old one running beside a new one.

    // 3: XHTTP packet-up upload POSTs complete instead of being held open as a duplex stream.
    // 4: configs are served over WebSocket instead of XHTTP -- one connection carries both
    //    directions, so nothing depends on separate requests reaching the same Worker isolate.
    // 5: the 401 body no longer returns the admin hash (it IS the session cookie, so every
    //    unauthenticated request was handing out a working key), and PUT /api/users/<name>
    //    no longer 503s when a field is omitted.
    // 6: Config Studio. Versioned migrator, the /{STUDIO_ROUTE}/v1/* control plane with bearer
    //    auth, users/configs/subscriptions, the rebuilt subscriber page, and legacy-auth hardening.
    //
    //    THIS MUST EQUAL `STUDIO_API_VERSION` in worker-src/studio/04a-studio-api.js. The engine
    //    reports that number from /v1/health, and StudioDeployer compares it against this one to
    //    decide whether deploying would go backwards. While they disagreed -- asset at 6, constant
    //    at 5 -- every successful deploy left the account looking NEWER than the app, so the
    //    downgrade guard fired on the next attempt and the app could never redeploy again. Found by
    //    deploying to a real account; `checkEngineVersion` now fails the build if they drift.
    // 7: nodes get a health probe measured on the PHONE and reported back, and the dashboard
    //    answers the counts it could not before -- people connected right now, live configs,
    //    node health, connections in the last day, and the month's traffic. `usage_hourly.sessions`
    //    is written for the first time; it was created by the first migration and incremented by
    //    nothing, so every connection figure in the product read zero.
    // 14: the subscriber page hands over a link that is pinned to the list format. It used to print
    //    the plain `/s/{token}` -- which, for the very common case of somebody who reached the page
    //    BY opening that link in a browser, is the URL already in their address bar, and reads as
    //    the status page rather than as a subscription. Nothing was added, so this build carries no
    //    new capability; it is bumped so existing installations report as behind and the operator
    //    is OFFERED the redeploy. A fix that ships inside the APK and is never redeployed is a fix
    //    nobody gets.
    // 15: a quota is enforced while the session is open. Usage reached D1 only in 50 MB commits, so
    //    a small cap (10 MB) never moved during a session and the connection ran on indefinitely;
    //    now every byte is counted against what is left and the session ends when it runs out.
    // 16: locations. `/v1/exits` holds SOCKS5 / HTTP exits per country and a config pinned to a
    //    country leaves through one of them, with no direct fallback. Also the abuse guard: torrent,
    //    mail, private targets and connection floods are refused, which is what gets accounts banned.
    // 17: multi-location. `/v1/pool` -- public per-country servers for a location with no exit of
    //    the operator's own, OFF until the operator turns it on knowingly; pool configs are named
    //    «⚠️ عمومی» and the subscription page says what that means. Users carry a list of ports.
    // 18: one usage meter for every transport (usage reaches the user row within ~90 s and moves
    //    `updated_at`, so the app sees it; quotas stop within a few hundred KB); device limits count
    //    devices connected NOW; WebSocket early data; XHTTP served as stream-one with its own
    //    credential and a country; a location config keeps one verified exit; DNS from the Worker.

     * [MLM] is the API surface; this is the database. A release can add a table and an index without
