 * Why several flows: the AWS GameLift beacons answer about two packets a second per flow (source

 * clean line. Ten flows at two packets a second each give the same 20 pps cadence on the line and
 * stay under the beacon's limit on every flow. Each flow is its own socket (a new source port),
 * or its own SOCKS association when measured through a relay.
 *
 * Sending runs on its own thread with parkNanos pacing; coroutine delays are millisecond-coarse
 * and drift under load, which shows up as fake jitter in exactly the number this measures.
