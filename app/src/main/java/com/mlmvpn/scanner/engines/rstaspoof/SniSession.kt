/**
 * The SNI engine and the config that rides on it, as ONE connection.
 *
 * They are two pieces and the screen used to show them as two: a dial that started the local TLS
 * front, and then nothing — the user had to work out for themselves that the front carries no
 * traffic on its own, leave for the connection list, find the folder of SNI configs and connect
 * one of them there. Two buttons on two screens for one thing, and no hint on either screen that
 * the other existed. The overwhelmingly common failure was turning on the engine, seeing "running",
 * and concluding the app was broken because nothing was unblocked.
 *
 * There is one button now, and this object is what makes that honest. The ordering is not
 * cosmetic: the config points at `127.0.0.1:40443`, so the front has to be listening before the
 * core dials it or the connection fails at the first packet.
 *
 * The sequencing itself already lives in [MyVpnService] — it detects an SNI config by where it
 * points and claims it through [RstaSpoofManager.acquire] before starting the core -- and gives it
 * back when the service is destroyed, which is what keeps the front from outliving the connection
 * that needed it. So this object does not re-implement any of that; it selects the route, picks
 * the config, and starts the service. What it adds is the part the service cannot know: WHICH
 * config, and which route.
