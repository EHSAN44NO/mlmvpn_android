     * One complete set of the engine's levers -- what the screen calls a «روش اتصال».
     *
     * `-method` ALONE IS NOT THE LEVER, and believing it was is why this never worked on one of
     * Iran's two big mobile networks. The engine takes five settings, and `-method` only chooses
     * which of the other four apply:
     *
     * * `-fragment-strategy` — `sni_split` | `half` | `chunk` | `record_frag`. **Defaults to
     *   `sni_split`**, and on the failing network `sni_split` is the one the DPI kills.
     * * `-fragment-delay` — seconds between fragments (default 0.1).
     * * `-no-raw` — no raw-socket injection. Raw sockets need root, so on an ordinary phone the
     *   engine falls back by itself (`method=fragment-fallback` in its log) -- and the fallback it
     *   picks is the failing default.
     * * `-ttl-trick` — send the fake record with a TTL that dies before the server.
     *
     * Measured on the device, over the operator this used to fail on, three attempts each against
     * one Cloudflare edge under one forged name (`500` = a real HTTP answer came back, so bytes
     * moved; `000` = curl got nothing):
     *
     * | profile | result |
     * |---|---|
     * | no engine at all, for reference | 500 · 500 · 500 |
     * | `fragment` + `chunk` | **500/2.0s · 500/1.4s · 500/1.2s** |
     * | `fragment` + `record_frag`, delay 0.02 | **500/1.4s · 500/2.1s · 500/1.8s** |
     * | `fragment` + `half` | 500/5.6s · 500/4.0s · 500/5.8s |
     * | `combined` + `-no-raw` | 500 · 000 · 000 |
     * | **`combined` — what shipped** | **000 · 000 · 000** |
     * | `fragment` + `sni_split` — the engine's default | 500 · 000 · 000 |
     * | `fake_sni` + `-no-raw` | 000 · 000 · 000 |
     *
     * So there is no single right answer -- `combined` is what works on the other operator, and it
     * carries nothing on this one. The list below is a LADDER, tried in order until one answers,
     * and the winner is remembered. Order is by how many users a rung is expected to serve, not by
     * how fast it was here: `combined` stays first so the network where it already works is not
     * made slower to fix the one where it does not.
