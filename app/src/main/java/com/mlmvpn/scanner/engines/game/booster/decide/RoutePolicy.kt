/**
 * From "what was measured" and "what the doctor found" to "where the game goes" -- pure, so every
 * rule below is a unit test.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they apply:
 *  1. The measurement's verdict ([RouteDecider]) picks between the direct line and WARP -- except
 *     that a direct line which merely did not answer the test points is NOT a reason to tunnel.
 *     Test points (GameLift beacons, anchors) are not the game: on a line that whitelists game
 *     servers and drops other foreign UDP -- Irancell -- they are silent while the game works.
 *     Tunnelling on that silence moves a working game into a slower path. So WARP is only forced
 *     when the doctor proves the game's own sign-in cannot be reached directly, or the user asked.
 *  2. What the user pinned wins, where it works at all.
 *  3. Signing in comes first: a sign-in the direct line cannot reach but WARP can, takes WARP; a
 *     sign-in refused on country is fixed by an anti-sanction DNS, and that beats a WARP whose
 *     only merit was a few milliseconds -- WARP leaves from an address the publisher still reads
 *     as Iran, so on WARP the player could not sign in at all.
