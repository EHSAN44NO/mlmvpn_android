/**
 * Checks each part of a game's traffic from this line and says what, if anything, is in its way:
 * nothing, a lying resolver, a filter on the name or the address, or the host refusing Iran.
 *
 * All hosts are checked at once and each is bounded, so a doctor visit costs one to two seconds
 * on a healthy line and never more than [HOST_BUDGET_MS]. The match itself is never checked --
 * match servers answer no probe -- so a verdict here is about signing in, the game's services,
 * downloads and the store, and the card says so.
 *
 * Results are kept per network and game for [TTL_MS]: which of a game's hosts are filtered or
 * sanctioned on a line changes on the scale of days, not boosts.
