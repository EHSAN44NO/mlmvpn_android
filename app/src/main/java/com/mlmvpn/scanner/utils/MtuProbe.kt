/**
 * Finds the exact largest packet a method can carry, so the MTU field can be a measurement
 * rather than a guess.
 *
 * ## Why it probes the OUTER path and subtracts, instead of probing through the tunnel
 *
 * The obvious test — bring the tunnel up and ping through it with the don't-fragment bit set —
 * cannot be run from inside this app. Every tunnel here excludes our own package from the tun
 * (`addDisallowedApplication`, see `TunnelVpnService.startWatchdog` for the same trap), so a
 * probe started by the app rides the carrier link no matter what is connected. It would measure
 * the Wi-Fi, report 1500, and be wrong on every method.
 *
 * What the app CAN measure from where it stands is the path the tunnel's own outer packets take,
 * which is the same path and the same link. So this probes THAT, exactly, and subtracts the
 * framing each method wraps an inner packet in. Both halves are checkable:
 *
 *  - the outer probe is ordinary PMTU discovery, binary-searched to the byte and confirmed at the
 *    boundary, so it is not a guess;
 *  - the overheads below were each measured on a real 1500-byte line by connecting the method,
 *    pinging through it from a shell (which is NOT excluded from the tun) and finding the exact
 *    size that stopped arriving.
 *
 * WireGuard is the one that proves the method: 1500 − 1440 = 60 bytes, which is exactly
 * 20 (IPv4) + 8 (UDP) + 32 (WireGuard) on paper. The arithmetic and the wire agree.
 *
 * ## The methods that are not measured
 *
 * Psiphon, Tor, V2Ray, SNI and Quick Connect do not carry inner IP packets at all. Their tun is
 * read by tun2socks, which terminates TCP on the device with its own stack and re-opens it
 * through a local SOCKS proxy — so nothing the tun MTU describes ever reaches the network, and
 * the number is a local buffer size. Bigger is strictly better there, which is why they are
 * [LOCAL_TERMINATION] and answer 1500 without a probe. Probing them would also fail for a second
 * reason: tun2socks forwards TCP and UDP and drops ICMP, so every ping through one of those
 * tunnels times out at every size.
