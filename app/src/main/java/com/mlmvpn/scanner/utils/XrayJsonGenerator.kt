     * connection leaves from the worker's IPv6 exit, a shared Cloudflare WARP range Google will not

     * from its IPv4 exit (104.28.x.x) and got the full Gemini page, twice out of two.

     * connection the ISP's resolver poisoned. `targetStrategy: UseIPv4` turns the name back into an
     * IPv4 address just before it leaves, looked up by [googleDnsServer] through the tunnel so the
     * ISP cannot poison it. When that lookup fails Xray sends the name as before, so this can only
     * ever help.
     *
     * NetDoctor (Dr.Net) gets the same effect from its whole design: sing-box resolves remotely

     * `streamSettings` for an outbound, from the one shared builder.
     *
     * This file used to construct `streamSettings` in **three** places -- `generateConfig`,
     * `generateAntiSanctionConfig` and `generateMultiConfig` -- and the three had already drifted:
     *
     *  - only `generateConfig` handled **xhttp** at all. The other two emitted `network: "xhttp"`
     *    with no `xhttpSettings`, so the mode fell back to a default that does not work through
     *    Cloudflare (it buffers request bodies, so anything but `packet-up` hangs). An xhttp config
     *    measured by `generateMultiConfig` was therefore being measured through a broken outbound.
     *  - `generateMultiConfig` sent `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0` where the other two sent a full
     *    Chrome string -- a two-token user agent is a fingerprint of its own.
     *
     * Both are fixed by there being one builder rather than three. [ConfigBuilder] is also what
     * Config Studio uses to *emit* configs, so the link this app hands out and the outbound it dials
     * cannot describe the same server differently.
     *
     * What stays here is what is genuinely about **this device dialling**, and has no meaning in a
     * config given to someone else: the unfiltering cipher swap below, and the `sockopt` pinning in
     * `generateConfig`.

     * timing out; everything else leaves `direct` (the first outbound), which in practice is only
     * the DoH resolvers' own connections.

     * they are the fastest and map CDNs to the nearest edge, where DoH to a foreign resolver was
     * slow and mapped by the resolver's location. DoH by IP stays as the last resort. Without ISP
