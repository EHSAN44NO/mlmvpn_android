/**
 * The four network choices that belong to the APP, not to any one engine.
 *
 * The app carries two VPN stacks and half a dozen engines on top of them, and four questions
 * apply to all of them: which resolver, which local port, tunnel-everything or proxy-only, and
 * may other devices on the network use the proxy. Those are properties of how the user wants
 * their phone to behave, not of which tunnel happens to be carrying the traffic.
 *
 * They were nonetheless answered twice. Settings held `backend_dns`, `local_port`, `proxy_mode`
 * and `allow_lan`; the five-transport screen held its own `dns_servers`, its own
 * `psiphon_lan_sharing` and a hardcoded SOCKS port of 1819; and the split-tunnel list existed in
 * two stores under two sets of mode names. So the same switch read differently depending on which
 * screen the user had last opened, and a port typed in Settings did nothing at all once a
 * transport was the thing running -- which presents as "the proxy I configured on my PC stopped
 * working when I changed tunnels", with nothing on screen to explain it.
 *
 * This object is now the only place any of them is read or written. The per-engine copies are
 * gone; [com.mlmvpn.core.tunnel.CoreConfig] and [com.mlmvpn.core.tunnel.TunnelPreferences] read
 * through here.
 *
 * **Storage is deliberately unchanged.** The keys and preference files are the ones the app has
 * always used, because changing them would silently reset every existing user's configuration.
 * What changed is that there is now exactly one reader per key.
