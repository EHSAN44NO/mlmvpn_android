/**
 * The MLMVPN shared pool: a live subscription built from what our own users measure.
 *
 * The free-server feeds this app reads carry ~11,500 configs of which roughly 1% work at any
 * moment. Measured on a 300-config sample from an Iranian mobile line: 36% open a TCP port, 20%
 * complete a TLS handshake for the name the config asks for, and about 1% pass a real proxied
 * request. The 36% is the misleading one -- most of it is shared Cloudflare addresses that accept
 * TCP from anyone while the domain behind them is long gone.
 *
 * Five thousand people run those sweeps every day and throw the answers away. This keeps them.
 *
 * The unit of storage is deliberately NOT "a config". A config that works on Irancell can be dead
 * on MCI at the same second, so everything here is keyed by (config, ISP) -- and the ISP comes
 * from Cloudflare's own `request.cf.asn`, which costs the client no permission and lets us bucket
 * fixed-line users (Shatel, Pars Online, TCI) correctly too. No IP address is ever stored.

// crash reports
//
// The app has always written a full stack to files/crashlogs/ and there was never a way for it to
// reach anyone. That gap is why "the app crashes when I open V2Ray" could be reported by several
// users and stay unreproducible for weeks: the artefact that answers it in a minute was sitting on
// their phones. This is the other end of that pipe.
//
// Since build 2 this is the FALLBACK. The app sends to the crash collector first (worker-src/crash,
// on another account, no database) and comes here only when that does not file the report -- this
// pool's own D1 and request limits are what used to lose crash reports on its busiest days.
//
// It is authenticated like every other endpoint, so a report is tied to an enrolled install and
// the same rate limit applies -- a crash loop cannot turn one phone into a firehose.
//
// WHERE THE REPORTS END UP, because it is not this file and not this account:
//
//   * GitHub, https://github.com/mlmvpn/crashes -- PRIVATE, and one issue per crash signature.
//     This is the copy a person reads, and the only one that notifies anybody. Requires the
//     GH_TOKEN and GH_REPO secrets below; without them `fileCrashOnGithub` returns on its first
//     line and says nothing, which from the app's side is indistinguishable from working.
//   * D1, the `crashes` table here -- one row per (install, signature), read through
//     `/crashes?k=<STATS_PASSWORD>`. This is the copy that can COUNT: it orders by distinct
//     installs, which GitHub cannot answer.
//
// The full path -- which file writes the stack, which screen offers to send it, how the signature
// is computed, how to test it end to end, and what to do when D1 is read-limited -- is written
// down once, in `docs/CRASH-REPORTS.md` in the mlmvpn_android repository. Start there.

 * ceiling and `/crashes` answered with a database error for the rest of the day -- so the reports
 * were unreadable on precisely the day a release went out and they mattered most. A bug tracker
 * that goes down with the thing it is tracking is not a bug tracker. GitHub also gives the parts a
 * dashboard never had: a notification when a NEW bug appears rather than a page someone has to
 * remember to open, a place to write down what was found, and a close button that means something.
 *
 * The D1 row is still written. It costs one indexed insert, it keeps `/crashes` working, and it
 * means a GitHub outage or a bad token loses nothing -- the reads were the expensive half, and
 * this replaces the need to read.
 *
 * The token lives as a Worker secret and never goes anywhere near the app: an APK is readable by
 * anyone who downloads it, so a token shipped inside one is a token given away. The repository it
 * points at MUST be private -- a stack trace names internal classes and the screens the user
 * walked through to get there, and the crash table has always been behind a password for that
 * reason.
 *
 * Deduplication is by signature, held in KV. If KV has no record -- a new namespace, an evicted
 * key -- the label is asked for directly, which is one request and cannot create a second issue
 * for a bug that already has one.
